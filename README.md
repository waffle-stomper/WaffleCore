## Shared components for various waffle_stomper mods

Notes: 

 - This repository contains code derived from work by TealNerd: https://gist.github.com/TealNerd/db5bae695552eaede90008e3f36cbea0
 
 - The mod uses the 'world_identifier' plugin channel to fetch world UUIDs from the WorldInfo plugin. As far as I know, no other plugins use this channel.
